# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

The Work Day Scheduler is a daily planning application that allows a user to input their tasks for the day and save the tasks. When tasks are saved by clicking the floppy disk button, the tasks will stay on the page even if the page is refreshed. Time blocks that have already occurred have grey input boxes; the current time block has a red input box; and time blocks that have not yet occurred have green input boxes.
